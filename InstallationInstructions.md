# Installation
This application is not packaged yet as a distributable Python package. Installing this requires manual downloading and unzipping.

1. Download the main branch in AutoLaserCalibration repo as a zip.
2. Unzip the content to `C:\AutoLaserCalibration`.

To achieve that, one can unzip the file to C drive and rename AutoLaserCalibration-main to AutoLaserCalibration.
3. Start command line prompt and navigate to `C:\AutoLaserCalibration\setup\'
